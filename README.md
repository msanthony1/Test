# Test
Hello
Testing GitHub.
Matthew Anthony, msanthony1@my.waketech.edu
My GitHub account is for my CTI-110 class. The repository I made was a test repository to just make sure I knew of the features and how to use it. I downloaded the GitHub desktop app, hit file in the top left corner of the screen, clicked Clone Repository, and selected the file destination on my desktop. Then I clicked clone and it cloned it.
